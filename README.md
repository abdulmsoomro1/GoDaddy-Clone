Notes

Educational Purpose: This project is a clone for learning and portfolio purposes, not for commercial use.
Attribution: The footer includes attribution to AbdulRahim Soomro, as specified in the project.
Simulated Functionality: Domain search, checkout, and navigation links use alerts to simulate functionality, as this is a front-end demo.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using media queries.
Logo: The original GoDaddy logo image has been replaced with a styled text element ("GoDaddy Clone") with a hover effect.

Known Limitations

No Backend: Domain search and checkout are simulated with JavaScript; no real API or database integration.
Dark Theme: The dark theme toggle adds a class but requires additional CSS for full implementation (currently minimal).
Static Links: Navigation and footer links trigger alerts instead of redirecting to actual pages.
Browser Compatibility: Tested on modern browsers; older browsers (e.g., IE) may not support all CSS features.
